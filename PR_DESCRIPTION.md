- **Real-time Highlighting**: Automatic highlighting of matching nodes and edges
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys for navigation, Enter to select, Escape to clear
- **Relevance Scoring**: Intelligent result ranking based on match quality
- **Match Highlighting**: Visual highlighting of matched text within search results

### 6.3 Traffic Statistics and Summary Displays ‚úÖ
- **StatisticsPanel Component**: Multi-tab statistics dashboard
- **Overview Tab**: Summary cards for records, traffic, connections, and rejection rates
- **Traffic Tab**: Top source IPs, protocol distribution, and port analysis
- **Connections Tab**: Connection status breakdown and destination analysis
- **Geography Tab**: Regional, VPC, and account-level statistics
- **Export Functionality**: CSV and JSON export for statistics and filtered data
- **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic recalculation when filters change
