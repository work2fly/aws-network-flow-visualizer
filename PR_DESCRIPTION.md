## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### New Components Created
```
src/renderer/components/common/
â”œâ”€â”€ ErrorBoundary.tsx       # React error boundary
â”œâ”€â”€ ToastNotification.tsx   # Toast notification system
â”œâ”€â”€ LoadingStates.tsx       # Loading components
â”œâ”€â”€ HelpSystem.tsx          # Help and tooltip system
â””â”€â”€ index.ts               # Common components exports
```

### New Hooks Created
```
src/renderer/hooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ useErrorHandler.ts      # Comprehensive error handling
â””â”€â”€ useOperationStatus.ts   # Operation status management
```

### Enhanced Files
- `src/main/ipc/query-handlers.ts` - Better error handling and validation
- `src/renderer/App.tsx` - Error boundary and toast integration
- `src/renderer/components/SSOAuth.tsx` - Enhanced with validation and feedback
- `src/renderer/components/layout/StatusBar.tsx` - Better operation status display
- `src/shared/types.ts` - Extended with error details and metadata

## ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Generic error messages that were hard to understand
- No loading feedback for long operations
- Limited help for complex features
- Poor error recovery options

### After
- **Clear, actionable error messages** with specific guidance
- **Visual loading indicators** with progress tracking and cancel options
- **Contextual help system** with tooltips and detailed explanations
- **Toast notifications** for immediate feedback
- **Form validation** with real-time error display
- **Error recovery options** with retry functionality
