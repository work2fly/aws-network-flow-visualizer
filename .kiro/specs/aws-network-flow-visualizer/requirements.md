# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a cross-platform network flow visualization tool for AWS environments with multiple VPCs connected via Transit Gateway. The tool will help network administrators and engineers visualize traffic flows, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and understand network patterns across complex multi-account AWS architectures. It will consume VPC Flow Logs and Transit Gateway Flow Logs from CloudWatch to provide interactive visualizations of network traffic direction, volume, and patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to visualize traffic flows between VPCs and site-to-site VPN connections through a Transit Gateway, so that I can quickly identify connectivity issues and understand traffic patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is launched THEN the system SHALL display an interactive network topology showing VPCs, Transit Gateway, and VPN connections
2. WHEN flow log data is loaded THEN the system SHALL render traffic flows with directional arrows indicating source and destination
3. WHEN traffic flows are displayed THEN the system SHALL use different colors and line thickness to represent traffic volume and direction
4. IF no traffic is detected between endpoints THEN the system SHALL highlight potential connectivity issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to query CloudWatch Insights for VPC and Transit Gateway flow logs, so that I can analyze real-time and historical network traffic data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to AWS THEN the system SHALL authenticate using AWS SSO, named profiles, or IAM roles, with preference for SSO and temporary credentials over long-term access keys
2. WHEN querying flow logs THEN the system SHALL support CloudWatch Insights queries for both VPC Flow Logs and Transit Gateway Flow Logs
3. WHEN data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL parse flow log records and extract source IP, destination IP, port, protocol, and action fields
4. IF query fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network troubleshooter, I want to filter and search network flows by various criteria, so that I can focus on specific traffic patterns or problematic connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing flows THEN the system SHALL provide filters for source/destination IP ranges, ports, protocols, and time ranges
2. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL update the visualization in real-time to show only matching flows
3. WHEN searching for specific endpoints THEN the system SHALL highlight matching nodes and connections
4. WHEN flows are filtered THEN the system SHALL display summary statistics for the filtered data set

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cross-platform user, I want the tool to run consistently on Linux, macOS, and Windows, so that I can use it regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing on Linux THEN the system SHALL run without platform-specific dependencies
2. WHEN installing on macOS THEN the system SHALL run without platform-specific dependencies  
3. WHEN installing on Windows THEN the system SHALL run without platform-specific dependencies
4. WHEN launched on any supported platform THEN the system SHALL provide identical functionality and user interface
5. IF platform-specific features are needed THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle differences and provide alternatives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a network analyst, I want to export and save network flow visualizations, so that I can share findings with team members and create reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a visualization THEN the system SHALL provide export options for common image formats (PNG, SVG)
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support CSV export of filtered flow log data
3. WHEN saving configurations THEN the system SHALL allow users to save filter settings and query parameters
4. WHEN loading saved configurations THEN the system SHALL restore previous filter and visualization settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to identify unusual traffic patterns and potential security issues, so that I can investigate suspicious network activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing flows THEN the system SHALL highlight connections with unusual port usage or traffic volumes
2. WHEN detecting rejected connections THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish denied traffic from allowed traffic
3. WHEN viewing traffic over time THEN the system SHALL provide timeline visualization showing traffic patterns
4. IF anomalous patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL provide alerts or notifications for investigation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the application to be completely self-contained with no external dependencies or data transmission, so that I can ensure my network data remains private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL NOT transmit any telemetry, analytics, or usage data to external services
2. WHEN processing flow logs THEN the system SHALL perform all data processing locally on the user's machine
3. WHEN communicating externally THEN the system SHALL ONLY connect to AWS APIs for CloudWatch Insights queries
4. WHEN installed THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies and libraries within the application package
5. IF network access is required THEN the system SHALL exclusively use HTTPS connections to AWS endpoints only

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want to authenticate using AWS SSO and named profiles, so that I can follow security best practices and avoid managing long-term access keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring authentication THEN the system SHALL provide AWS SSO login flow with browser-based authentication
2. WHEN using profiles THEN the system SHALL read and utilize AWS CLI configuration files and credential profiles
3. WHEN SSO tokens expire THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication and handle token refresh automatically
4. WHEN multiple profiles are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to select and switch between different AWS profiles
5. IF long-term access keys are provided THEN the system SHALL warn users about security risks and recommend SSO or temporary credentials
